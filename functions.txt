Comprehensive Test Suite for Jira Agent
This plan covers all major features, including searching, analysis, and the new conversational ticket creation flow.

I. Core Searching & Filtering
Test 1.1 (Keywords & Limit):

Prompt: show me 3 tickets about system hangs

Verify: The GUI displays exactly 3 tickets related to "system hangs".

Test 1.2 (Program & Project Distinction):

Prompt: find me a stale stxh ticket

Verify: The agent correctly identifies stxh as a program and finds one stale ticket within that program. It should not throw an "invalid project" error.

Test 1.3 (Invalid JIRA Key):

Prompt: summarize plat-123*456

Verify: The GUI displays an immediate error message stating the JIRA key format is invalid, without attempting a search.

II. Stale & Time-Based Queries
Test 2.1 (Custom Stale Search):

Prompt: show tickets untouched for 90 days

Verify: The backend logs show a JQL query with updated < "-90d".

Test 2.2 (Year/Month Date Search):

Prompt: find bugs created in the last year

Verify: The backend logs show the query was correctly converted to use days (e.g., created >= "-365d") and the search executes successfully.

III. User-Based Queries
Test 3.1 (Assigned to Me):

Prompt: what tickets are assigned to me?

Verify: The GUI displays a list of tickets assigned to the user configured in your .env file.

Test 3.2 (Name Formatting):

Prompt: find issues reported by Ian Heath

Verify: The backend log shows a Built JQL with the correctly formatted name: reporter = "Heath, Ian".

IV. Analysis & Summarization
(Use real ticket keys from your Jira instance for these tests)

Test 4.1 (Aggregate Summary):

Prompt: summarize PLAT-12345 and PLAT-54321 (use two related tickets)

Verify: The GUI displays the two individual summaries, followed by a final "Aggregate Summary" section with a high-level analysis.

Test 4.2 (Duplicate Detection):

Prompt: find duplicates for PLAT-179648 (use a key with known duplicates)

Verify: The GUI displays a detailed list of the potential duplicate tickets.

V. Conversational Ticket Creation
Test 5.1 (Full Conversational Flow):

Start: Use the suggestion chip or type Create a new ticket. The agent should respond by asking for a summary.

Provide Summary: Type System crashes when running S0i3 test. The agent should ask for the Program and present a dropdown/buttons with options.

Select Options: Click the options (e.g., "STXH", "System-Strix Halo Reference Board", "High", etc.) as the agent asks for them.

Provide Text: When the agent asks for "Description" or "Steps To Reproduce", type a full sentence or paragraph.

Finalize: When the agent says all fields are set, click the "Finalize Ticket" button.

Verify: The entire process should feel like a smooth conversation, with the GUI dynamically updating. The final ticket should be created successfully in Jira.

Test 5.2 (Cancellation):

Start: Begin the ticket creation process.

Provide a few fields.

Cancel: When it asks for the next field, type cancel ticket creation.

Verify: The agent should respond with "Ticket creation process has been cancelled." and the process should stop.
