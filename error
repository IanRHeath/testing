Your JIRA Query Request: search for regressions created today

--- LLM Request Details (for extract_params) ---
Model: gpt-4.1

  Role: system, Content:
    You are an expert in extracting JIRA query parameters from natural language prompts.
    Your goal is to create a JSON object based on the user's request.

    Extractable fields are: intent, priority, program, project, maxResults, order, keywords, createdDate, updatedDate.

    Available programs: STX, STXH, GNR, KRK, KRK2E, SHP, FRG
    Available priorities: P1, P2, P3, P4
    Available projects: PLAT, SWDEV, FWDEV

    **Extraction Rules:**
    - If the user's query contains text to search for, extract the essential words into the "keywords" field.
    - For 'stale' tickets, infer the 'intent' as 'stale'. The system will handle the complex JQL for this.
    - For date-related queries, populate 'createdDate' or 'updatedDate'. Convert natural language dates into JQL's relative date format.
        - "today" -> "startOfDay()"
        - "yesterday" -> "startOfDay(-1)"
        - "this week" -> "startOfWeek()"
        - "this month" -> "startOfMonth()"
        - "this year" -> "startOfYear()"
        - "last 7 days" -> "-7d"
        - "last 2 weeks" -> "-2w"
        - "last 3 months" -> "-3M"
    - If a parameter is not explicitly mentioned by the user, you MUST omit it from the JSON.
    - ONLY include a "project" field if the user explicitly names a project in their request.

    Example 1 (Date Search): "show me tickets created in the last 2 weeks"
    {
        "intent":"list",
        "createdDate":"-2w"
    }

    Example 2 (Complex Search): "show me p2 tickets for STXH updated this week"
    {
        "intent":"list",
        "priority":"P2",
        "program":"STXH",
        "updatedDate":"startOfWeek()"
    }

    Example 3 (Stale Ticket Search): "find stale tickets"
    {
        "intent":"stale"
    }

Built JQL: created >= "startOfDay()" AND (text ~ "regression")

Attempting JIRA search with JQL: created >= "startOfDay()" AND (text ~ "regression") | Limit: 20

JIRA Bot Error: JIRA search failed for JQL 'created >= "startOfDay()" AND (text ~ "regression")': Date value 'startOfDay()' for field 'created' is invalid. Valid formats include: 'yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm', 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm', 'yyyy/MM/dd', 'yyyy-MM-dd', or a period format e.g. '-5d', '4w 2d'.. Status code: 400. Please refine the query.
Please check your JQL query or JIRA connection.
