  "aida_summary": "###SMU Analysis:### \n **Summary:**\n\nThe debug log indicates issues with PMFW, specifically related to SMU and mailbox communication. The SMU team should investigate the problem further.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **smu_problem_detected**: This field is true, indicating a problem with PMFW. This suggests that further analysis of MP1 is necessary, and AIDA should report a problem with SMU.\n\n2. **smu_double_exception_occurred**: This field is false, so there is no double exception on MP1's MicroController.\n\n3. **pc_is_changing** and **function_is_changing**: Both fields are true, indicating that PMFW is not stuck in a loop or register access.\n\n4. **smu_mailbox_interfaces_stuck_evidence**: This field is true, suggesting that the mailbox used to communicate with SMU is stuck. This is a significant issue that should be highlighted in the 'Executive Summary'.\n\n5. **smu_test_mailbox_exercise_pass**: This field is false, indicating that a test message sent to SMU's TEST message port by ADS did not get a response, further supporting the mailbox issue.\n\n6. **axi_slave_error_occurred**: This field is false, so there is no slave error in MP1's access to another IP.\n\n7. **kernel_error_occurred**: This field is false, indicating that PMFW's Kernel has not stopped for an invalid case or unrecoverable error.\n\nGiven the evidence from the debug log, the primary issue appears to be with the SMU mailbox communication. Therefore, the SMU team should be tasked with investigating and resolving the problem. \n \n###PSP Analysis:### \nTo provide a summary and explanation, I need the specific values from the debug log for the **mpasp_fw_status_value** field. Please provide these values so I can proceed with the analysis according to the instructions."
